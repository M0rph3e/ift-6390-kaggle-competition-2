# Introduction
In this project, we participate in a Kaggle competition where the goal is to design a machine learning algorithm to classify locations around the world on 2 different classes :
* Crop land : **1**
* Non-crop land : **0**

To do so we have a dataset that containing 12 months of  meteorological and climatological data. This set is composed of a 216 features subset of the [CropHarvest](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=JtjzUXPEaCu) dataset where every data points corresponds to a geographical location.

The goal of this project is to implement and train classification algorithms in order to have the highest performance on the test set available on Kaggle. The scoring in this competition is based on the [f1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score). 

Four baselines needs to be beaten on this competition :

1. A dummy classifier that predicts the most frequent class in the set  : **0.71886**
2. A weak machine learning algorithm : **0.94736**
3. • A stronger machine learning algorithm : **0.97841**
4. The TA's best baseline : **0.99516**

We will first see which algorithms and methodologies were done for this competition.
Then we will see and discuss our results.
