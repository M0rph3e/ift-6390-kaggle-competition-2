# Kaggle Competition 2 : CropHarvest : Coding Part
### This readme is here to help you to run our code implementation for the Kaggle submissions.

## 1. The format

There is 1 submissions in a python notebook format which was used and implemented on Google Colaboratory :

`Kaggle2_exploration.ipynb`

## 2. Library Used

Overall the python library used for both of them are the following :

```
sys #for system commands
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
import multiprocessing
pandas
sklearn
pickle
seaborn
```

## 3. Run the code

For this notebook you can just sequentially execute each cells, by pressing `shift`+`enter` for examples.

This notebooks use the **Kaggle API** to import the dataset from the competition. So you need to provide a **JSON** token in the second cell output for each notebook.

For more precisions, you can check how to have your token file on the API documentation of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).
